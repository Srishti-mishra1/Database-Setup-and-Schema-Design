# Database-Setup-and-Schema-Design
Building an E-Commerce schema from scratch

I created 6 tables comprising of Customer, Product, Order, Order Details, Payment and Reviews. Then these tables had sub-tables comprising the necessary components in each of them, like name, ID, etc. Stated the primary and foreign keys of all of them so that each tables stays connected well to each other in the schema. I didn't use a database from the web this time beacuse I myself wanted to explore which fields I can think of in each of the tables.
